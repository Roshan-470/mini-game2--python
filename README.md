# 🎯 Number Guessing Game in Python

A beginner-friendly **Python console game** that blends logic, randomness, and user interaction. This project was built to practice fundamental Python concepts in a fun and engaging way. It's a great choice for anyone looking to strengthen their programming basics or start building projects early in their coding journey.

## 📌 What is the Game?

This is a command-line number guessing game where:

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player has 5 chances to guess the number.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback — whether the guess is **too low**, **too high**, or **correct**.
- If all 5 attempts are used without guessing correctly, the game ends and reveals the secret number.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🎲 Random number generation using `random.randint()`
- 🎯 5-attempt limit to increase challenge
- 🔄 Feedback after every guess: “Too high” or “Too low”
- ❌ Input validation using `try-except` to prevent crashes
- 🎉 Victory message or failure message depending on outcome
- 👨‍💻 Beginner-friendly and fully interactive in terminal

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Loops (`while`)
  - Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  - Exception handling (`try/except`)
  - Random module (`random.randint`)
  - Console I/O (`input()`, `print()`)
