## 🎮 About the Game

This is a command-line based **Number Guessing Game**. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback — whether the guessed number is too high or too low. Simple logic, yet incredibly effective for learning the core concepts of Python.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to improve and expand this project:

🚀 Feature	💡 Description

🧩 Difficulty Levels	Let the user choose Easy (10 attempts), Medium (5), or Hard (3)

🕹️ Replay Option	Add functionality to restart the game without rerunning the script

📊 Score Tracking	Track the number of wins and attempts and display stats

💾 Save High Score	Store scores in a .txt or .json file to track best performance

🖼 GUI Version	Use tkinter to create a graphical interface instead of console-based

🌐 Web-Based Version	Build using Flask or Django to deploy as a simple web app

🔔 Sound Effects	Use winsound (Windows) or playsound to add alert tones for feedback

🌈 Fancy UI with Colors	Use libraries like colorama for colorful terminal output
